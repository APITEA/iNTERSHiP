### Git & Github

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

GitHub is a project management and code versioning system as well as a social network platform made for developers. But what is GitHub used for? Well, amongst all, it allows you to work collaboratively with other people around the world, plan your projects and track your work.
